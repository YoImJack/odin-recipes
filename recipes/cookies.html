        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Who doesn't like a chocolate striped cookie? These copycat fudge stripe cookies taste just like your childhood Keebler favorites - 
            but improved with real chocolate and an all-butter cookie. They're made with a simple sugar cookie dough that is very easy to work 
            with and roll out. I used semisweet chocolate to echo the sweeter taste of the Keebler originals, but you can of course use any 
            chocolate you like.</p>
