        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Who doesn't like a chocolate striped cookie? These copycat fudge stripe cookies taste just like your childhood Keebler favorites - 
            but improved with real chocolate and an all-butter cookie. They're made with a simple sugar cookie dough that is very easy to work 
            with and roll out. I used semisweet chocolate to echo the sweeter taste of the Keebler originals, but you can of course use any 
            chocolate you like.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup unsalted butter, softened</li>
            <li>¾ cup granulated sugar</li>
            <li>1 large egg</li>
            <li>1 ½ teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon kosher salt</li>
            <li>2 ½ cups all-purpose flour</li>
